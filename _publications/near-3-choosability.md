It is currently an unsolved problem to determine whether, for every $2$-list assignment $L$ of a $\triangle$-free planar graph $G$, there exists an independent set $A_L$ such that $G[V_G\setminus A_L]$ is $L$-colorable. However, in this paper, we take a slightly different approach to the above problem. We prove the $\mathbb{NP}$-completeness of the decision problem of determining an independent set $A$ such that $G[V_G\setminus A]$ is $2$-choosable for  $\triangle$-free, $4$-colorable graphs of diameter $3$. Building upon this notion, we examine the computational complexity of two optimization problems: minimum near-$3$-choosability and minimum $2$-choosable-edge-deletion. In the former problem, the goal is to find an independent set $A$ of minimum size in a given graph $G$, such that the induced subgraph $G[V_G \setminus A]$ is $2$-choosable. We establish that this problem is $\mathbb{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $|V_G|^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$, for planar bipartite graphs of arbitrary large girth.
On the other hand, the problem of minimum $2$-choosable-edge-deletion involves determining an edge set $F \subseteq E_G$ of minimum cardinality such that the spanning subgraph $G[E_G \setminus F]$ is $2$-choosable. We prove that this problem can be approximated within a factor of $O(\log |V_G|)$.
