I completed my PhD from the Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, under the supervision of Dr. Narayanan N. My research interest lies in algebraic combinatorics, topological combinatorics, and graph algorithms. 

I am currently a visiting fellow at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai with Dr. Amritanshu Prasad.
